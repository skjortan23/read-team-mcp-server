# Red-team-mcp
An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI agents to use during red teaming exercises.

## Overview
This server provides resources and tools for AI agents to access during red teaming scenarios. It implements the Model Context Protocol to allow AI agents to retrieve information, access tools, and perform actions needed for security testing and evaluation.

## Components

### 1. Scanner
- Integrates with masscan for high-speed port scanning
- Allows AI agents to discover open ports and services on target networks
- Configurable scan parameters (IP ranges, port ranges, scan rate)
- Results parsing and formatting for agent consumption

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up basic MCP server structure
2. Implement masscan integration with parameter validation
3. Create result parsing and storage mechanisms
4. Add additional components (forthcoming)
5. Implement logging and monitoring
6. Build permission and boundary systems

## Usage
Instructions for connecting AI agents to this server will be provided here.

## Development
Details on extending the server with new tools and resources will be added.
